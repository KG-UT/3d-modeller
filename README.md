# 3d-modeller

This is a small and somewhat unfinished 3d modeller. 
Currently it is able to run, initializes with a cube in the centre, has to ability to rotate, and can zoom in and out. I have not yet added the ability to create and move objects.

## Prerequisites
You need the following packages:
- pyopengl
- numpy

## Running
Simply run viewer.py

## Usage
Click and hold the right mouse button, then move to rotate the space. Scroll up or down with the mouse wheel to zoom in or out respectively.
